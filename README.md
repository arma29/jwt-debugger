# JWT Debugger

## The Project

This project has as the main goal to provide a debugger, capable of decoding and verifying JSON Web Tokens, according to [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519). Simply paste the token into input section and click the button, the entry will be decoded as well and a signature check will also be done. You can find more about JSON Web Tokens [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token). **Finally**, you can see my implementation up close **[here](https://arma29.github.io/jwt-debugger/)**.
